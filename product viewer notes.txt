You need to write a React application using any backend framework of your choice.
React + .Net Core Web API

The application needs to display a list of products to the user. 
--> Product List Feature

The user has the ability to add these items to a virtual basket and have the front end update.
--> Basket Feature

Once the products are added to the basket the user will have access to a 'go to basket' button to perform a check out of the products.
--> Display Checkout Feature

The checkout page will present the basket items to the user. The user can remove items from the basket here.
--> Basket Feature

The checkout page will call a backend to calculate the total shipping cost. $10 shipping cost for orders less of $50 dollars and less. $20 for orders more than $50.
--> Shipping Feature

The page will need to contain a country selector. Based on the country selected you need calculate the basket total based on the country and display the prices of the total, basket items and product pages in the correct currency.
--> Display Checkout Feature

Include 3 countries in the selector their own foreign currency conversion rate.
--> Display Checkout Feature

The checkout page will have a place order button which will post all the products to a method and will return success to the page. Once that is complete the page will navigate to a 'thank you' page
--> Complete Order

The focus of the exercise is on the code only. The pages should be neat but the focus is not the design.

You'll need to provide front-end and back-end unit testing.
--> Front End jest for components

--> Back end nunit / moq / postman
