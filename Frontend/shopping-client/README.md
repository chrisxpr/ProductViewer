## Front End Application Overview

The following sections provide guidance to understand the structure of the front end application's main technical features.

### Design System

The shopping client front end application uses tailwind for its design and theme. To view the steps performed to configure the react application with tailwind please visit: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app).

The main files pertaining to the tailwind setup are:

    /postcss.config.js
    /tailwind.config.js
    /src/index.css

### Layout

The general layout for the application pages is defined in the file:

    /src/components/layout/main.js

The structure consists of a simple header and footer around the main page content as follows:

    <div>
      <div className="flex flex-col h-screen">
        <Header />
        <main className="flex-grow">
          <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4">{props.children}</div>
        </main>
        <Footer />
      </div>
    </div>

### Folder Structure

The sample app files are grouped in the following structure:

    /src
    	/components --> ui components
    	/helper		--> shared helper functions
    	/routes		--> ui routes
    	/services	--> api service wrapper
    	/store		--> state management

### Configuration

The following properties are configured in the file shoppingConfig.js:

    export const shoppingConfig = {
      apiUrl: 'https://localhost:7166/api/v1.0/',
      siteName: 'Shopping Client',
      timeout: 20000,
    };

The properties **apiUrl** and **timeout** are used to configure api calls, while **siteName** is used in the layout.

### Routing

Url routing is provided using the react-router-dom npm package with route behaviour configured in the file App.js:

    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Products />} />
      <Route path="cart" element={<Cart />} />
      <Route path="complete" element={<Complete />} />
    </Routes>

and index.js:

    <BrowserRouter>
      <Layout>
        <App />
      </Layout>
    </BrowserRouter>

### State Management

State Management for the application is configured in the following locations:

    /store
      /actions
      /constants
      /reducers
      provider.js

**provider.js** configures the Store that is used across all the components as follows:

    import { createContext, useReducer } from 'react';
    import { initialShopState, shopReducer } from './reducers/shopReducer';

    export const Store = createContext();

    export function StoreProvider(props) {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(shopReducer, initialShopState);
    const value = { state, dispatch };
    return <Store.Provider value={value}>{props.children}</Store.Provider>;

and is referenced in **index.js**:

    <React.StrictMode>
      <StoreProvider>
        <BrowserRouter>
          <Layout>
            <App />
          </Layout>
        </BrowserRouter>
      </StoreProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>

### API Client

The code responsible for integration with the WebAPI can be found in the folder:

    /services

The file **shoppingClient.js** contains an API service wrapper used by the store actions to interface with the WebAPI controller actions.

    const shoppingClient = (() => {
      const instance = new ShoppingService();
      instance.init(shoppingConfig);
      return instance;
    })();

The **ApiHelper** class used in the ShoppingService uses the axios package to manage http requests to the WebAPI layer.

## Front End Application Features

To initialise the project and install dependancies you will need to run the command:

    npm run install

To start the react application run the command:

    npm run start

Before starting the front end application make sure that the WebAPI solution is running and the value of **apiUrl** is correct in shoppingConfig.js. The value of **apiUrl** should match up with the value of **applicationUrl** in Properties/launchSettings.json in the ShoppingAPI project.

### Home page

The home page loads a set of products from the WebAPI /product controller endpoint. These are rendered in a grid with the country defaulting to Australia(AU).

This can be changed to Italy(IT) and USA(US) accordingly which will result in the currency code and amounts updating on the screen.

In the demo these mappings are static and configured in

    store/reducers/shopReducer.js

in the **initialShopState** variable:

    countryList: [
      {
        countryCode: 'AU',
        currencyCode: 'AUD',
        exchangeRate: 1.0,
      },
      {
        countryCode: 'IT',
        currencyCode: 'EUR',
        exchangeRate: 0.67,
      },
      {
        countryCode: 'US',
        currencyCode: 'USD',
        exchangeRate: 0.7,
      }
    ]

with the current selction stored in the **countryInfo** variable:

    countryInfo: {
      countryCode: 'AU',
      currencyCode: 'AUD',
      exchangeRate: 1.0,
    }

A future version would most likely pull this data from an api to allow use of upto date exchange rate data.

### Adding Products

To add a product simply select the desired quantity from the select control and click 'Buy'

After adding the products the quantity of items in the basket and a link to 'Go to basket' will be visible.

### Shipping Information

On loading the shopping cart page the shipping cost will be retrieved from the WebAPI layer using the [order/calculateshipping] uri.

Where the cart cost is greater than AUD $50 the shipping cost will be $20

<img src="https://dzappstordevmgmtauest.blob.core.windows.net/assets/documentation/product-viewer/Screenshot-6.png" width="600">

If it is less than AUD $50 the shipping cost will be $10

<img src="https://dzappstordevmgmtauest.blob.core.windows.net/assets/documentation/product-viewer/Screenshot-7.png" width="600">

The costs will also be updated based on the selected country:

(IT)

(US)

<img src="https://dzappstordevmgmtauest.blob.core.windows.net/assets/documentation/product-viewer/Screenshot-9.png" width="600">

### Order Submission

Clicking on the 'Place Order' button will submit the cart contents to the [order/process] uri.

<img src="https://dzappstordevmgmtauest.blob.core.windows.net/assets/documentation/product-viewer/Screenshot-10.png" width="600">

On completion of the request the user will be taken to the complete page with the cart state reset.

## Future Enhancements

- Move country / currency list behind an api call
- Use local storage to persist application state
- Improve API security using PKCE, JWT token etc
- Increase the code coverage of UI tests
